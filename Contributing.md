# Contributions are welcome

To avoid unnecessary work, I recommend the following process.

1. **Get in touch with me, before you start working on it.**

   We might have different ideas about how to add a specific functionality, so let us discuss this first.
   Either open an issue ticket here in Bitbucket or contact me (taranion#5388) on [Discord](https://discord.gg/USE9Gte)
   
2. **Make a branch per issue**

   After you forked the repository and when you want to work on several issues, a good practice is to have a dedicated branch (and pull request) per issue you want to work on. That way problems with a specific issue don't prevent merging the other work.
   
3. **Put the issue number in the first line of commits and pull requests**

   That helps later in tracking changes.
